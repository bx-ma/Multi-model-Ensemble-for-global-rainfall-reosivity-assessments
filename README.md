# Multi-model-Ensemble-for-global-rainfall-reosivity-assessments
We found 260 groups of empirical rainfall erosivity models documented in previous studies. These models were systematically filtered. As a result, we filtered and compiled 77 groups of empirical models. In total, 162 models were involved in the analysis.
